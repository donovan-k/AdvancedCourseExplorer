## Project Summary
This project takes the original course explorer offered by UIUC and upgrades it
to be more personal for each student. Our web application will take into account 
the student's account information such as their major, interests, favorite professors,
and the GPA they are looking for. Based on these factors, our application will create a 
list of courses that student would enjoy or need to take. 
For example, if the student's major is Computer Science, and they are interested
in data science, then the application will list data analysis courses and/or other 
statistical analysis courses for them to take.
